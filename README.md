# peek-a-repo 👀

**hover to preview files and folders on github.**

got frustrated clicking back and forth just to check what's inside a file, so i'm building this to fix it.

simple idea: hover over a link -> see the content.

currently a work in progress. 🚧

dev: `npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./tailwind.css --minify --watch` ~ run this while developing to watch for changes and compile the css
